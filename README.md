# Diabetes-Analysis--Naive-Bayes-From-Scratch

The test problem is obtained from Pima Indians Diabetes problem.

We have 768 observations and 9 features.

The records describe measurements taken from the patient such as their age, the number of times pregnant and blood workup.

All patients are women with an age above 21.

All attributes are numeric, and their units vary from attribute to attribute.

Each record has a class value that indicates whether the patient suffered an onset of diabetes within 5 years of when the measurements were taken (1) or not (0).If 0 - not suffered else suffered.

A good prediction accuracy is 70%-76%.
